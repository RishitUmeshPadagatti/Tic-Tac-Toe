# Tic-Tac-Toe
A basic console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. Features include two-player turns, prevention of invalid moves, and thorough win condition checks horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. The game displays the current board after each move and declares a winner when a player achieves three in a row in any direction.
